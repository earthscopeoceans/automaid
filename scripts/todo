get rid of next_dive gps list requirement: just make a textfile detailing all of
the interpolation parameters!!!

Look at implication of adding abs() to gps2dist_azimuth if statement concerning
20 m

Apply filter date just to SAC and MSEED file creation?

*_interp_gps should have DIVE ID as the first column
