[ ] MERMAIDs 43, 44, 45, 49: missing KSTNM column in GPS measurement (and
    others?) row; prints ",,"

[ ] `gps_before_dive_incl_prev_dive` and `gps_after_dive_incl_next_dive` are not
    compiled correctly in cases when there is no complete prev/next dive because
    splitting the gps list requires a descent/ascent to parse `after` and
    `before`.  Maybe consider entire list of prev/next dive in cases when no
    dive?

[ ] IcDive folders are not cleaned up in cases when .LOG/.MER incomplete
    transmission later completed (e.g., '452.020-P-23/20211205-05h35m54sIcDive')

[ ] "incl_preliminary" in main,py
    - Untested with newest versions; likely does not work
    - Supersedes tool_invert_mer.py; delete that when this is fixed
