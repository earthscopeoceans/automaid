TL;DR

This proves that the interpolated locations based on the complete (.LOG and
.MER) GPS list, as compiled by me in automaid v2.0.0, do not differ
significantly (mostly around or less than 100 m) from those locations generated
by Seb's original code, which used just the .MER or .LOG lists.

$OMNIA commit:

870567d9503c390daf3f6e12a55c4217c9930cd3

with:

allowed_date_diff = 1e-3; % milliseconds
allowed_dist_diff = 1e-3; % ~100 m

i.e., flag all SAC files with GPS-interpolated locations greater than ~100 m
using my new scheme of concatenating GPS from .LOG and .MER in automaid v2.0.0.

old_new_diff_light compares $MERMAID/test_processed, which was completely remade
with "redo = True" in main.py, with $MERMAID/processed commit:

870567d9503c390daf3f6e12a55c4217c9930cd3

The diff text files are this dir's txt vs
$PAPER20/automaid_version_diffs/old_new_diff_light.txt; diff.txt is a straight
diff and diffy is a diff -y.

We can see the diffs are nearly identical--some things are different--but
overall there are no major changes.

Again, we know that this latest version is correct and the old versions are
wrong because they did thing like, e.g., reuse "wtcoeffs.icdf25_5", which was
fixed in automaid v1.4.0.
