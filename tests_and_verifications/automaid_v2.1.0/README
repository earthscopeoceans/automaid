Using automaid v2.1.0 -- 23-Oct-2020

This tests tool_invert_mer.py cross-references the dates spanned in the .MER
before attempting to invert binary event blocks contained in the same .MER file.

Unlike the full automaid process, tool_invert_mer.py only accepts a single .MER
file and no .LOG files as input; therefore, it cannot do GPS interpolation and it
requires the .MER environment correspond to the events it contains -- it cannot
go look at all other .MER environments and match the dates to the events like in
the full automaid process.

This example uses:

25_5F84D5E5.MER
25_XXXXXXXX.MER

which are identical except that in the latter I artificially shifted the event
date forward by one year (to 2021) to force tool_invert_mer.py to skip that
event.

To run the examples from within this directory (zsh) --

$ conda activate pymaid
$ python $AUTOMAID/scripts/tool_invert_mer.py 25_5F84D5E5.MER
$ python $AUTOMAID/scripts/tool_invert_mer.py 25_XXXXXXXX.MER

______________________________________________________________________________________

You will see that the first example produces output SAC files and plots, while
the second produces nothing and instead ends with the following printout:

Event at 2021-10-06T10:17:54.599456Z is not associated (date out of range) with 25_XXXXXXXX.MER environment...skipping
