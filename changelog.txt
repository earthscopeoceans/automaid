At some point:
   -- reconcile READMEs before different remotes

Upcoming:
* v1.0.0
  -- Fix P-25.vit with early return in Events.py

* v0.3.0
  -- Add version to "kuser0" SAC header field

Current:
* v0.2.0
  -- Make paths relative to $MERMAID and $AUTOMAID
  -- Known issues (I0.2.0_1): icdf24_v103_test and icdf24_v103ec_test in
     $AUTOMAID/scripts/bin (after running make in $AUTOMAID/scripts/src/[V103
     and V103ec] and moving them) do not run with fullpaths:

     Y: "icdf24_v103_test 5 1 wtcoeffs"
     N: "$AUTOMAID/scripts/bin/icdf24_v103_test 5 1 $AUTOMAID/scripts/bin/wtcoeffs"

* v0.1.0
  -- Base version, with minor modifications from Seb's listed in remote_diffs/
     (that directory of plain text files is slated for removal, but may be
     retrieved from that release) 
  -- Known issues(I0.1.0_1): P-25.vit does not process (GPS issue);
