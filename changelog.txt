* v1.2.0
  -- modified Events class so that single MER file may be passed as opposed to
     default of globbing entire input base path

Current:
* v1.1.0: 17-Sep-2020
  -- GPS clock-drift correction added to USER3 variable in SAC header
  -- Packaged version number stored in setup.py and imported in scripts
  -- Fixed tool_invert_mer.py fixed, which now allows flexible path declarations/
     future: apply events.correct_clock_drift?
  -- Forced directory change into $AUTOMAID/scripts/bin/ in
     events.invert_transform to patch issue I0.2.0_1 where the scripts do not
     allow fullpath inputs
  -- Removed local server/ and processed/ directories: those go in $MERMAID

Previous:
* v1.0.0: 11-Sep-2020
  -- Fix P-25.vit gps.linear_interpolation crash with early return in dives.py

* v0.3.0: 11-Sep-2020
  -- Add version to "kuser0" SAC header field
  -- Print .MER (if any) that accompanies each .LOG to stdout

* v0.2.0: 09-Sep-2020
  -- Make paths relative to $MERMAID and $AUTOMAID
  -- Known issues (I0.2.0_1): icdf24_v103_test and icdf24_v103ec_test in
     $AUTOMAID/scripts/bin (after running make in $AUTOMAID/scripts/src/[V103
     and V103ec] and moving them) do not run with fullpaths:
     Y: "icdf24_v103_test 5 1 wtcoeffs"
     N: "$AUTOMAID/scripts/bin/icdf24_v103_test 5 1 $AUTOMAID/scripts/bin/wtcoeffs"

* v0.1.0: 08-Sep-2020
  -- Base version, with minor modifications from Seb's listed in remote_diffs/
     (that directory of plain text files is slated for removal, but may be
     retrieved from that release)
  -- Known issues(I0.1.0_1): P-25.vit does not process (GPS issue);

Todo:
  -- Reconcile READMEs across different remotes
