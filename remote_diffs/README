There are three (3) versions of automaid floating around as of generating V0.1.0
for publishing on EarthScope-Oceans github (early September 2020).

1) This version, local to JDS
git@github.com:joelsimon/automaid.git

2) Seb's version, the original author
https://github.com/sebastienbx/automaid.git

3) The current ESO version,
git@github.com:earthscopeoceans/automaid.git

This folder contains the differences between these three versions.

Versions 1) and 2) are nearly identical (as far as Python scripts are concerned,
the READMEs do differ), because I have been pulling Seb's updates and making
minor changes to them. The differences between 1) and 2) are immaterial as far
as processed data concerned, except that in some SAC files I set
stats.sac["user2"] = self.trig.

The python scripts in Version 3) are out of date and will now be overwritten by
my version and maintained from there.
