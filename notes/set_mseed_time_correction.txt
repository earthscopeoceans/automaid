Some notes previously attached to:

util.set_mseed_time_correction.py

See `tests_and_verifications/mseed_fixed_section_data_header.py` for a
discussion of the fixed header and subsequent blockettes (e.g., 1001, 1000)
that (seem to?) precede every record an mseed file written by ObsPy v1.2.1.

# miniSEED convention:
#
# [1] record start + time correction = corrected record start
# [2]  (mer_time)  +  (clockdrift)   =      (gps_time)
# (VERIFIED: POSITIVE time correction ADVANCES corrected record start)
#
# MERMAID convention:
#
# [3] clockdrift = gps_time - mer_time
# [4] mer_time + clockdrift = gps_time = eq. [2]
#
# MERMAID's clock drift and SEED's time correction are of the same sign
# SEED's time correction and time delay are of opposite sign
# Therefore, SEED's time delay is opposite sign of MERMAID's clock drift
#
# positive time correction = record (MER) time EARLY w.r.t. truth (GPS)
# ==> (+) time correction = (-) MER delay
#
# negative time correction = record (MER) time DELAYED w.r.t. truth (GPS)
# ==> (-) time correction = (+) MER delay
#
# Toggle `time_correction` flag between True and False and use:
#
#     $ `libmseed/example/mseedview -p  <mseed_filename>`
#     $ `python -m obspy.io.mseed.scripts.recordanalyzer -a <mseed_filename>`
#
# to convince yourself of this
