This directory needs to contain ALL the incoming server files, *LOG,
*MER, *vit, *cmd files and the whole lot, and the `main.py` script will
process it all and distribute it over the `processed` directory
incrementally.

Not useful to give one or two examples of these files, you have to
have the whole thing running to get this to work as advertised.

In my own work I keep my (copy) of the server somewhere, 

`$somewhere/server`

and then, in there, I make

`$somewhere/processed`

and then, since `main.py` is a bit explicit, I PHYSICALLY NEED TO COPY
the scripts directory from where I usually keep my other python
scripts, as by the environmental variable $YFILES,

`cp -r $YFILES/automaid/scripts $somewhere`

I then have a script `$UFILES/servercopy` which syncs the data from the
server and maintains a git repo of those files.

And then for processing, I change INTO the directory $somewhere,
where, since I usually am not in bash, I execute the sequence:

`module load anaconda/5.2.0`\
`bash`\
`source activate pymaid`\
`python scripts/main.py`\
`source deactivate`

after which I should find the processed files inside
`$somewhere/processed`. Note that I reference a very particular
anaconda module to make this work. 

If for some reason you should have the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environmental
variable set, unset it. In bash that would be using `unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
